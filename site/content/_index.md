      "Thank you so much for your help. Talking to guys at EEC was exactly what
      I was lacking for clarity and progress. Checking them out was the best
      decision I made after my graduation."

      "Initially I was a bit skeptical before meeting them. There was so much to
      do and so much uncertainty. EEC gave me confidence and clarity. I felt I
      was navigating on an unknown island with an experienced guide. Thank you!"

    Coffee is an amazing part of human culture but it has a dark side too – one
    of colonialism and mindless abuse of natural resources and human lives. We
    want to turn this around and return the coffee trade to the drink’s
    exhilarating, empowering and unifying nature.
