**Student halls of residence:**

Student halls of residence are usually located near the student campus and admission into them is done on a strict first-come-first-serve basis. Halls of residence offer international students accommodation with great potential for socialisation with fellow students and cheap rent.



**Shared accommodation**

In the scenario where student halls of residence are completely booked, students can opt for shared accommodation. As compared to halls of residence, these are more economic friendly and convenient. Shared accommodations consist of a number of students sharing 2-3 rooms and splitting the utilities between them. Students can check out WG-Gesucht, Studenten-WG.de and WGcast for such accommodation options.



**Apartments**

Some students might prefer staying alone, hence they can choose to live in an apartment.

Others like to rent an apartment sharing together. Getting an apartment without a job contract maybe though nut to crack.



**On-campus hostels**

Not all German universities have on-campus hostels, but the ones that do have limited slots for students that are determined on a first-come-first-serve basis.
