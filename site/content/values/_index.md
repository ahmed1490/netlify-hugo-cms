      Coffee is a small tree or shrub that grows in the forest understory in its
      wild form, and traditionally was grown commercially under other trees that
      provided shade. The forest-like structure of shade coffee farms provides
      habitat for a great number of migratory and resident species.

      Single-origin coffee is coffee grown within a single known geographic
      origin. Sometimes, this is a single farm or a specific collection of beans
      from a single country. The name of the coffee is then usually the place it
      was grown to whatever degree available.
  - heading: 3. Receive offer letter(s) and make your decision

      Sustainable agriculture is farming in sustainable ways based on an
      understanding of ecosystem services, the study of relationships between
      organisms and their environment. What grows where and how it is grown are
      a matter of choice and careful consideration for nature and communities.
